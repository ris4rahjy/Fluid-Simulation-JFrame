# Fluid Simulation using JFrame

## The following is a particle-based simulation which seeks to mimic fluid behavior. 

### A few features are listed below.

Now with a Resizable window!

Press P to pause simulation.

Particle velocity determines the color of the particle; the faster particles are more red then the slower ones.   
This gradient occurs until all particles are moving at or around the same velocity.  

Particles operate identical to the real world. With no pressence of gravity, particles gravitate towards less dense regions.  
The particles therefore propel and attract eachother towards its ideal position.  

To activate gravity, the 'G' key must be pressed.

The mouse cursor can be used to create a zone of attraction/repulsion, based on whether a right click or left click was performed.

Particle observation can be changed to and from circles, as well as to and from gradients.  
To add/remove the circles, press 'I'.  
To add/remove gradients, press 'O'.
